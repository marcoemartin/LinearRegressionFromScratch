# LinearRegressionFromScratch
This is a first attempt at creating a Linear Regression model from scratch using the Boston housing prices data set 
found on the Sci-kit Learn module.

This example only uses one feature and accurately creates a linear model that can be used to predict the price for 
additional bedrooms in a house in Boston.

# Linear Regression From Scratch
This is a first attempt at creating a Linear Regression model from scratch using the Boston housing prices data set 
found on the Sci-kit Learn module.

This example only uses one feature and accurately creates a linear model that can be used to predict the price for 
additional bedrooms in a house in Boston.

The method used to solve the coefficients is Ordinary Least Squares which is used to minimize the error in the function until
it finds the most optimal function.
